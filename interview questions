1. What makes a password strong?

A strong password is:

Long: At least 12–16+ characters.

Random: No dictionary words, names, or predictable patterns.

Mixed: Uses uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Unique: Not reused across multiple accounts.

The combination of length, entropy (randomness), and uniqueness makes a password much harder to crack.

2. What are common password attacks?

Brute-Force Attack: Tries all possible character combinations until the correct one is found.

Dictionary Attack: Uses lists of common passwords and words with substitutions (e.g., "Pa$$word").

Credential Stuffing: Uses previously leaked username-password pairs to try accessing other accounts.

Phishing: Tricks users into giving away their credentials through fake websites/emails.

Keylogging: Malicious software records every keystroke, including passwords.

3. Why is password length important?

Password length is the biggest defense against brute-force attacks.

Short passwords (8–10 characters) can be cracked in seconds or minutes.

Long passwords (16–20+ characters) can take centuries with current computing power.

Each additional character exponentially increases the possible combinations.

4. What is a dictionary attack?

A dictionary attack uses a precompiled list of common words, names, and predictable substitutions to guess passwords quickly.
For example:

“password”, “Password1”, “Pa$$word”, “qwerty”, “123456”
Defense: Use randomness and avoid real words in passwords.

5. What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?

MFA requires two or more verification methods before granting access.
Examples of factors:

Something you know: Password or PIN.

Something you have: Smartphone, security token.

Something you are: Fingerprint, face, voice.

This adds an extra security layer, so even if a password is stolen, the account remains protected.

6. How do password managers help?

Password managers:

Generate strong, random passwords automatically.

Store all passwords securely in encrypted vaults.

Eliminate password reuse, since each account can have a unique password.

Sync across devices, making secure logins more convenient.

7. What are passphrases?

A passphrase is a long sequence of random or nonsensical words.

Example: BlueHorse$Plays99DrumsQuickly

Easier to remember than random characters.

Still very strong because of length and unpredictability.

8. What are common mistakes in password creation?

Using short passwords (less than 12 characters).

Relying on dictionary words or names.

Using predictable patterns like “123456”, “abcd1234”.

Reusing the same password across multiple accounts.

Using obvious substitutions like “Pa$$word” or “Admin123”.

Not enabling multi-factor authentication.
